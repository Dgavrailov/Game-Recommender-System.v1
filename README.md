Overview
Welcome to the Game Recommender System project! This project is designed to recommend video games to users based on their preferences. The system features a user-friendly graphical user interface (GUI) built with JavaFX and utilizes intelligent agents developed with JADE (Java Agent DEvelopment Framework) to facilitate communication and recommendation processes.

Features
User-Friendly GUI: The interface is intuitive and easy to navigate, allowing users to interact with the recommendation system seamlessly.
Intelligent Agents: The system uses JADE to implement intelligent agents that communicate with each other to generate game recommendations.
Agent Communication: One agent sends a message to another agent, initiating the recommendation process.
Ontology-Based Learning: The receiving agent learns from an ontology, which is a structured framework that organizes information about video games, to provide accurate and personalized recommendations.
Efficient Recommendation Process: The agents work together to analyze user preferences and deliver game recommendations quickly and efficiently.

Technology Stack
JavaFX: Used for building the graphical user interface (GUI).
JADE: Employed for creating and managing the intelligent agents.
Ontology: Made by Protege. Utilized for the agent's learning process to improve recommendation accuracy.
